# STL  
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++ programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functional, and iterators.(from wikipedia)  
You can read different types of STL's source code in different folders and I recommend you to read sgi's code and houjie's comment.  
Folder called rewrite includes some codes wriiten by myself when I'm learning STL.
