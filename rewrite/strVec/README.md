# Introduction
A text query program, using a string vector, a simplification of the library vector class. So it's just for practicing, with a little practical significance.   
This program has two parts: `strVector` and `TextQuery`. 
You can edit `file.txt` and query some word , just have a try!

# strVector
## Class design
Class `strVector` preallocates enough storage named `capacity()` to hold more elements than needed. And those storgae will be constructed until we need them. Constructed storage is named `size()`.  
Each action to add element checks if there is enough space available in `capacity()`. If not, we need to reallocate more storgae(2 times than before) and move elements to new strogae.   
To obtain acceptable performance, we need an allocator to get raw memeory, construct/destory them, and free them at last.  
```
[ 0 ][ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ][  unconstructed   ]
  ^                   ^                ^
elements           first_free         cap
```
Each StrVec will have three pointers into the space it uses for its elements:
- elements, which points to the first element in the allocated memory
- first_free, which points just after the last actual element
- cap, which points just past the end of the allocated memory  

## Memory manage
### constructor and destructor
When a `strVector` is constructed first time, `elements`, `first_free` and `cap` are all set to `nullptr`. And when destructed, we call member `free()`.  
Member `free()` need to destory element and deallocate memory.   
We should check if element is nullptr, which means the vector is empty.    
For convenience, destory begins at `first_free`. And because block that `first_free` points to is unconstructed, we need to move it forward before destorying.
```
[ 1 ][ 2 ][  ][  ]
      ^    ^
     --p   p
```
```cpp
void strVector::free() {
  if (elements != nullptr) {
    for (auto p = first_free; p != elements; /* empty */)
      alloc.destroy(--p);
    alloc.deallocate(elements, capacity());
  }
}
```

### element access
Recall vector in standard library, we can use an iterator to access element from both sides. `begin()` points to the first element, `end()` points to next block of the last element.  
Add and remove element are restricted from back. Take `push_back()` as an example, we need to check if there is enough memeory. If so, we construct `first_free` and move it to next block.  
```cpp
void strVector::push_back(const string& s) {
  check_alloc();
  alloc.construct(first_free++, s);
}
```

### element move
In member `reallocate()`, we need move element from old `strVector` to new `strVector`. But copying the data in these strings is unnecessary. Our StrVecâ€™s performance will be much better if we can avoid the overhead of allocating and deallocating the strings themselves each time we reallocate.  
To avoid copying, we use [`std::move`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/move/?kw=move), which is defined in `<utility>`  

# Text Query
## Class design
### Targets
1. When it reads the input, it should remember every line that every word appears. 
2. When it generates output,
- The program must be able to fetch the line numbers associated with a given
word
- The line numbers must appear in ascending order with no duplicates
- The program must be able to print the text appearing in the input file at a given line number.

### Data structure
- We use `strVector` to store every line of the text file and `std::isstringstream` to desperate word.
- We use `std::set` to store the line number, with which we don't need to sort the line number.
- We use `std::map` to associate a word with its line number(`std::set`).

### Class declaration
To query word, we define a class `TextQuery`. It obtains a `std::map` and a `std::vector`. So searching finishes after the class being constructed.    
And we define another class `QueryResult` to print search answer. It overrides the operator `<<`. 

## Details of definition
### share_ptr
`QueryResult` need to express the searching answer, which is saved in `TextQuery`. If we copy a duplicate, it wastes time and space, which may cause a copy of the whole file. And it's not safe to return a pointer/iterator to another class, so `share_ptr` couldn't be a better choice. Auto pointers in both class pointed to the same storage, and it'll auomatically free memory.
```cpp
class TextQuery {
/* other members */
  map<string, shared_ptr<set<line_no>>> file_map;
  shared_ptr<strVector> fptr_vec;
};

class QueryResult {
/* other members */
  shared_ptr<strVector> fptr_vec;
  shared_ptr<set<line_no>> lines;
```
